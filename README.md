# Using Machine Learning to predict Gender and Age of Perpetrators
We must intensify our efforts to combat crime. When looking into illegal activities, a specific process must be followed since understanding how to recognize and prevent criminal conduct depends so heavily on this work. This work may be used as a guide to assess earlier studies to find connections and recurrent themes. The two main elements of crime prediction are the goal of this research in order to meet this goal. The age and sexual orientation of the criminal are only two examples. Unanswered crimes can be researched in a variety of ways, such as by looking at contextual details like the weather, the day of the week, and the weapon that was used. How so many unsolved questions there still are is shown by the research. You must include details about the offender, such as their year, sex, and connection to the victim, in order for us to determine who they are. Data gathered from the internet competitive center Kaggle is used in this study.
